// share a same event loop (io_manager). The protocols' message
// handling can start and stop in unison. Stats reporting can also be
// done on the collective of protocols.
//
// Internally, the ServiceManager uses one dedicated thread for
// pooling for ready sockets (including listening ones) and a thread
// pool to serve the callbacks associated with these sockets.
//
// Thread Safety:
//
//   The class is thread safe. In particular, it is safe to call
//   stop() from any thread. It is also safe to call it more than
//   once, even if from different threads.
